# HotelSahan
I have used MVC framework along with Java to build this  project. I have created this project using Netbeans IDE. This is a simple hotel management system which will update a database. I have used sql to connect the database. View of my project will be given in hsview.jpg file. The whole project will be included in AmarshaHotel folder. This is the first time that I have uploaded a project to GitHub. I hope to contribute more in the future.
